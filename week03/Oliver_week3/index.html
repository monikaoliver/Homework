        <p> Miniature horses are designated by their height, ranging from 34-38 inches tall. Their size is that of a pony, but their characteristics are that of a horse. They are friendly creatures and do well as family pets. </p>

        <p> Mini horses are not only pets, but prominent show animals. They are also used as service animals, as they live longer than dogs and can be trained to do similar tasks. The downfall is that they are considered livestock, and should not be kept indoors for long periods of time. <br>
